# README

## Introduction

This README provides a step by step guide to the analysis process of
data from the code.gov platform from initial data collection to final
results.

The analysis was a component of a larger study performed for the
following project:

> EAGER: Measuring the Impact and Diffusion of Open Source Software
> Innovation on Contributor and Project Networks
>
> [NSF AWARD \#
> 2306160](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2306160&HistoricalAwards=false "NSF Award Abstract")

Further information and complete documentation along with results of the
project can be found on:

Researchers can reproduce the results of the code.gov component of the
study using this README. Complete documentation is provided for each
script used along with the data dictionaries and metadata for input and
output data files. Visual diagrams of data and script directories are
provided.

## Packages

The GitRipper package was developed to support this work. GitRipper is a python module can be used to get repository and commits information given a public GitHub owner and repository. This module supports multiple API keys with built-in usage monitoring and balancing and can help with large-scale data collection.
